# Countermeasure Recommender (CMR)

## Introduction

The CMR is an envisioned i2CATâ€™s asset to determine relevant security appliances to be deployed to enforce a certain set of security properties with respect to the constrains issued from the deployment environment. In the context of H2020 PALANTIR, this security properties are structured as policies (Medium-Level Security Policies, MLSP), describing both the types of mechanisms to be deployed and their configuration. An approach based on constrain programming has been selected to drive the design and the implementation of this component. This supposes eliciting the CMR features as a constrain satisfactory problem (CSP) addressable via CP and modelling as a set of equations indicating (i) a set of variables to solve with their interval definition (ii) a set of constrains restricting the set of solutions and (iii) the selection of an objective variable to identify the most optimal solution.

In H2020 PALANTIR's architecture, this software serves at the service matching componnent.
